## Quick FAQ

- **“No copyright” means what exactly?**  
  With **The Unlicense**, you dedicate your work to the public domain. Anyone can use, modify, or redistribute it for any purpose, without permission.

- **Do I still need a license file if I add the notice in the script?**  
  Yes—keep the `LICENSE` file in the repo. It’s the standard way GitHub and others recognize the terms.

- **Can I include `.msi/.mst` in the repo?**  
  Generally no—better to **ignore** them (`*.msi`, `*.mst`) and download from the official source in the script (which you already do).

If you want, tell me your repo name and I’ll tailor the README title/links and a short description you can paste directly into GitHub’s “About” box.
